<h4>you don&rsquo;t need a story.</h4>
<p>Rhythm games are so great in fact, that you don&rsquo;t even need a story. They do be different, don&rsquo;t they?<br />
It feels instinctive. Flickering lights and colors, the high-pitched fast paced sound keeps you alert, and present in the moment.<br />
It has got to have something to do with some dopamine neurotransmitter thing.<br />
I really wouldn&rsquo;t be able to tell you.</p>
<h4>how come</h4>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been very good at this game genre, I just like playing.<br />
¯\_(ツ)_/¯\<br />
But like a scientist trying to maximize the pulp size of a fruit, I couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking about how come no one mix piano and rhythm games before.<br />
It&rsquo;s a natural fit. You can&rsquo;t play piano without rhythm&hellip;\<br />
Would it be possible to make a rhythm game that teaches you how to play the piano while having fun?<br />
I can say right away it wouldn&rsquo;t make sense to have Osu teach me music theory in their tutorials.<br />
But what if you could first play the piano game for the fun of its rhythm and tempo, and then later on, you could learn music theory.\<br />
Can you make the learning piano experience more gamified, whilst not affecting the gameplay?</p>
<h4>let&rsquo;s talk content</h4>
<p>If you&rsquo;re creating a piano learning app, you&rsquo;d need to fund teachers and record snippets of music theory and how to perform certain techniques.<br />
That&rsquo;s why this project is a rhythm game, not a piano learning app.</p>
<p>I prefer going the other way &lsquo;round this problem, I want to rely on the community to create content and to give feedback on other&rsquo;s people play through.<br />
That&rsquo;s why this game is going to be open source, I&rsquo;ll be taking suggestions and feedback from the community.<br />
Making it easier for contributions, bug reports, content creation, and much more.</p>
<h4>what&rsquo;s the plan</h4>
<p>Play any of your .mid files.\<br />
Use practice mode to loop specific difficult parts you&rsquo;re having trouble with.<br />
Slow down the tempo, so you can learn at your own pace.\<br />
When you&rsquo;re ready to tackle the song in full, you can play it in ranking mode, having your score go into the leaderboards.\<br />
A replay system, so you can watch other people&rsquo;s play through and learn from them.</p>
<h4>for the tech</h4>
<p>I&rsquo;m picking the rust language because I wanted to learn it. Although I&rsquo;m not sure whether this is the best choice.\<br />
ggez is the game framework of choice, I&rsquo;ve seen something about it&rsquo; being portable to the web and mobile, but I haven&rsquo;t put any effort into that.\<br />
I&rsquo;m using the midly crate to parse .mid files, midir to play midi files.\<br />
And the voices inside my head to tell me what to do.</p>
<h4>what&rsquo;s the progress</h4>
<p>Let&rsquo;s cut to the chase, I&rsquo;ve been working on this for a few months now, and I&rsquo;m starting to wrap on the core gameplay.\<br />
Here&rsquo;s what I got:</p>
<ul>
<li>PC keyboard input (mostly for debugging);</li>
<li>a buggy midi file parsing;</li>
<li>for midi playback;<ul>
<li>input playback;<ul>
<li>for the notes you play;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>song playback;<ul>
<li>for the notes you&rsquo;re supposed to play;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>note hit detection;</li>
<li>a dumb note hit scoring system.</li>
</ul>
<p>No UI or menu system yet, I&rsquo;m focusing on the core gameplay first.<br />
Up next is Piano input and improve the scoring system.</p>
<h4>wrap up</h4>
<p>You defo need to see what&rsquo;s coming up. Stay tuned as we plan for releasing.<br />
Follow us on itch, as well as the youtube channel and github repo.\<br />
Share your thoughts, suggestions, and especially feedback.<br />
Don&rsquo;t forget to keep on piano-ing!</p>
