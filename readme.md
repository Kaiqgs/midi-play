- [X] Bit encoding for mode filtering
- [ ] B#1 fix bug: where last track on track library is blurred
- [ ] B#2 fix bug: where some mids are not parsed correctly
- [ ] B#3 fix bug: where resources_folder have weird prefix characters
- [ ] B#4 fix bug: where track library does not properly center on even number of tracks;
- [ ] #1 as dev: understand how note_count, note_height impact scale
- [ ] #2 as user: import mids to library
- [ ] #3 as user: delete mid from library
- [ ] #4 as dev: render notes partially and optimize by chunk
- [ ] #5 as dev: understand latency and physical piano input
- [X] #6 - as user: see smooth animations lerping;
	- [X] .a - interp track library
- [X] #7 - as user: import songs/tracks from outside;
	- [X] .a - as user: import any simple mid
	- [X] .b - as user: import complex mids (mid track);
		- complex mids have cover art, metadata, difficulty and are rankeable;
- [o] #8 - as dev: clean TODO's
- [o] #9 - as dev: clean warnings and strict code
- [ ] #10 - as user: reflect imported songs without restarting (minor)
- [ ] #11 - as user: see track names in track library;
- [ ] #12 - as dev: review all expect() calls, replace with Result return if appropriate
- [ ] #13 - as user: see track library circle in any aspect ratio
	- [ ] .a - as user: see elipse
	- [ ] .b - as user: see circle
		- shift and scale
